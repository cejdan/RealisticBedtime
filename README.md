# Stardew Valley mod - Realistic Bedtimes for the farmer

The Stardew Valley Farmer works way too hard! They wake up at 6am every day, and are in bed around 2am. That is a total of 4hours of sleep every day! I don't know about you, but I can't function with 4 hours of sleep each day. This mod fixes that, by making the farmer less and less functional the more sleep-deprived you become. Coffee becomes a must if you get too sleep deprived.

## Features
This is a **Challenge Mod** That makes the game directly harder, by giving you less time each day for activities. Currently, this mod changes the game logic in the following ways:

| Bedtime               | Consequence |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| 6:00 am to 10:00 pm   | Energized! (+1 Speed all day, full stamina) |
| 10:10 pm to 12:00 am  | Tired (-1 Speed all day, start with 1/2 stamina) |
| 12:10 pm  to 1:00 am  | Very Tired (-2 Speed all day, start with 1/3 stamina) |
| 1:10 am to 1:50 am    | Exhausted! (-3 Speed all day, start with 1/4 stamina) |
| Pass out at 2:00 am   | Non-functional (-10 Speed all day, start with no stamina) |


## To-do / Wishlist

- [ ] Build increasing consequences for multi-day late nights / all-nighters, decrease penalty for a single late night.
- [ ] Have better rewards for multi-day early bedtimes.
- [ ] Always sleep 8 hrs! Figure out how to skip time so that if you go to bed at 1am, you wake up at 9am instead of 6am.
- [ ] Once time-skip is working, figure out how to add a custom option when you go to bed so that you can choose your wake-up time (i.e. "set your alarm clock") - if you choose to sleep in you miss the morning hours but aren't as exhausted. Ideally, missing the morning hours would have some tangible consequence, like animals are grumpy, but maybe missing hours is enough penalty.
- [ ] Add "Sleep debt", every hour you are under 8hrs you have an increasing probability of oversleeping past your alarm. Or if you don't set an alarm, you sleep up to 10hrs in a single day, to recover your sleep debt!
- [ ] Once wake-up time choice is working in the dialog, add an alarm clock to the bedside for better visual effect! Maybe a sound-effect too on day-start.
